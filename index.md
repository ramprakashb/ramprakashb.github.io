### Projects

## System Verilog Design and Verification of Floating Point Processor
System Verilog design of Floating point hardware to perform basic arithmetic oprations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of single precision floating point numbers. The design also includes normalisation and rounding of the final output values. The design is verified using unit test cases and randomization.  
### Tools Useed: 
    Mentor QuestaSim

## Intruder Alarm system using Android App, Google Firebase and MQTT protocol
The objective of the project is to design a intruder alarm system by using face detection in raspberry pi and user notification using Android App. The face detection algorithm is run in raspberry pi interface with a pi cam. Once the face is identified then the image is transferred to Firebase Storage and notified to the Android App built using Java programming language through Firebase Cloud services. Once the user is notified then he has the option to open the view the image from the database or turn on the alarm using MQTT protocol.
### Tools Used:
    Android Studio, MQTT Mosquitto Server, MQTT Paho Client, Firebase cloud services, Firebase Realtime database, Firebase Storage

## Closed loop Automatic Irrigation system using RTOS and PID Controller
Implemented a closed loop automatic irrigation system using Nexys A7 FPGA controller. The overall architecture of the project involves using PID controller implemented in software using C language in FreeRTOS which runs above a hardware designed in Verilog using the Xillinx MicroBlaze softcore. The control is given from a Android App built using MIT App Inventor. The wireless control is facilitated by ESP32 pmod interfaced to the Nexys board. 

### Tools Used:
    Xillinx Vivado

## Verilog Design of a Cache Controller:
Verilog design and simulation of Last Level Cache employing write allocate policy with 8 way set associativity. Used MESI protocol to ensure cache coherence with a 4 way set associative cache. The design also employs Pseudo LRU (Least Recently Used) policy for cache replacement. 

### Tools Used:
    Mentor QuestaSim

## Intelligent Roomba using Robotic Operating System (ROS)
Implemented localisation and navigation using ORB-SLAM and gmapping in ROS built using a raspberry pi, LIDAR, PiCam and a refurbished Roomba. Autonomous navigation is enabled using raspberry pi connected wirelessly to the Laptop which perfoms the processing required for navigation. 

## Tools: 
    ROS Gazebo
